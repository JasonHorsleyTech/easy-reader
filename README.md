# EasyReader

## Pitch

Ever read some long hard Russian novel, and all the names are difficult to pronounce, and the writer also insists on using all possible Russian nick name variations, and everyone talks over eachother and you kind of have to sort out who says what at any given time, and you kind of wonder if Dostoevsky was a sadist?

Easy Reader is a project I'm mostly starting so that my github isn't filled with exclusively Pubbly Xprize related content, and also to prove to future prospective employers that I'm framiliar with Angular. Oh, and it color codes spoken dialog, with a character reference sheet in the right hand column, so you can tell what's going on.
